# Codewars

Codewars is a platform that I use to learn, train, and improve my coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Codewars is where developers achieve code mastery through challange. In this challange I'll be primarily training on kata in the dojo written in javascript. This will include different data types, logic, algorithms, arrays, and much more. Codewars is an excellent resource for learning Javascript as it covers the fundaments of the language as well as clever solutions to unique problems.  

## Optimizations

I started out doing challenges in the codewars website, over time I decided to add my challenges to my 100Devs project repository. Now that there are enough file in the project I've created a seperate respository to house all my codewar projects in a single place.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those _whoa this is awesome_ or _wow I actually did it!_ moments. During this project of doing a codewars everyday has been a great learning experience.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
