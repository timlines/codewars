# Codewars

Codewars is a platform that I use to learn, train, and improve my coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

I started out doing challenges in the codewars website, over time I decided to add my challenges to my 100Devs project repository. Now that there are enough file in the project I've created a seperate respository to house all my codewar projects in a single place.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those _whoa this is awesome_ or _wow I actually did it!_ moments. During this project of doing a codewars everyday has been a great learning experience.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
